# Please read this before opening a pull request

- If your PR is a trivial change (e.g. fix a typo, make a minor, non-functional improvement to the code, etc.), go ahead and submit your PR. Thanks for the help!
- If your PR is a non-trivial change (e.g. add a new feature, a new target framework, refactor large parts of the code, etc.), please discuss it with me in
  issues first, and don't submit a PR before we agree on what needs to be done. I appreciate the help, but if your PR is not a change I agreed to, there's a
  risk you will have done the work for nothing, and nobody wants that! If we have already discussed it and agreed, please go ahead :wink:
